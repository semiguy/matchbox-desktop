Favourite Idea 1
- use GtkRecent to store the count of apps being started
- show top 10 most run apps

- Just have a context menu to add/remove apps to the favourite group

Single Instance
- Support GtkUnique directly via keys in desktop files?


GIO Port
- port desktop to 100% async gio
- don't read anything on creation, rely entirely on item-added signals as
  directories are scanned
- emit finished signal when the initial sweep is done, so icons can then be
  loaded and the boot continued
